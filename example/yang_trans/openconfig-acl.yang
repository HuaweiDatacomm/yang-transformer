     "into ACL sets, with each set\ncontaining one or more ACL entries.  ACL "+
     "sets are identified\nby a unique name, while each entry within a set is "+
     "assigned\na sequence-id that determines the order in which the ACL\nrules "+
     "are applied to a packet.\n\nIndividual ACL rules specify match criteria "+
     "based on fields in\nthe packet, along with an action that defines how "+
     "matching\npackets should be handled. Entries have a type that indicates\nt"+
     "he type of match criteria, e.g., MAC layer, IPv4, IPv6, etc.";
