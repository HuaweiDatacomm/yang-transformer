     "This module describes configuration and operational state data\nfor routes"+
     " that are locally generated, i.e., not created by\ndynamic routing "+
     "protocols.  These include static routes, locally\ncreated aggregate routes"+
     " for reducing the number of constituent\nroutes that must be advertised, "+
     "summary routes for IGPs, etc.\n\nThis model expresses locally generated "+
     "routes as generically as\npossible, avoiding configuration of protocol-spe"+
     "cific attributes\nat the time of route creation.  This is primarily to "+
     "avoid\nassumptions about how underlying router implementations handle\nrou"+
     "te attributes in various routing table data structures they\nmaintain.  "+
     "Hence, the definition of locally generated routes\nessentially creates "+
     "'bare' routes that do not have any protocol-\nspecific attributes.\n\nWhen"+
     " protocol-specific attributes must be attached to a route\n(e.g., "+
     "communities on a locally defined route meant to be\nadvertised via BGP), "+
     "the attributes should be attached via a\nprotocol-specific policy after "+
     "importing the route into the\nprotocol for distribution (again via routing"+
     " policy).";
